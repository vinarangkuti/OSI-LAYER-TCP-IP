SNIFFING
--------	

Sniffing is is an application that can view data traffic on computer networks. Because the data flows back and forth on the network, the application captures each packet and sometimes describe the contents of RFC (Request for Comments) or other specifications. Based on the network structure (such as a hub or switch), either party can tap the whole or any of the traffic division of one of the machines on the network. Network control devices can also be managed by tapping to work in mixed mode (promiscuous mode) to "listen" items (generally on the cable network).
