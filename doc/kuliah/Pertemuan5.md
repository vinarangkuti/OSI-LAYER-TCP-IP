SPOOFING
--------	

In the world of perhackeran often heard the term "IP spoofing" IP Spoofing is also known as the Source Address Spoofing, is counterfeiting attacker's IP address so that the target assumes the attacker IP address is the IP address of the host in the network instead of from the outside network. IP Spoofing occurs when an attacker 'outsmart' packet routing to change the direction of the data or transmissions to different destinations.

Spoofing is the process of giving false addresses to the victim so that the victim will follow the fake address. Suppose the attacker has type A 66.25.xx.xx IP address when the attacker perform these types of attacks that attacked the network will assume the attacker IP is part of their network, eg IP type C. 192.xx.xx.xx ie IP Spoofing occurs when an attacker ' outsmart 'packet routing to change the direction of the data or transmissions to different destinations. Packet routing is usually transmitted in a transparent and clear so as to make the attacker to easily modify data origin or destination of the data. This technique is not only used by the attacker but also be used by security professionals to download tracing the identity of the attacker.
