REMOTE AUTHENTICATION DIAL-IN USER SERVICE (RADIUS)

Remote Access (in some literature Authentication) Dial-In User Service, which is often shortened to RADIUS, is a computer security protocol used for authentication, authorization, and centralized user account registration to access the network. RADIUS is defined in RFC 2865 and RFC 2866, which was originally used to authenticate the remote network access (remote) by using a dial-up connection. RADIUS has now been implemented to authenticate the network access remotely using a connection other than dial-up, as well as Virtual Private Networking (VPN), wireless access point, Ethernet switches, and other devices. RADIUS was originally developed by the company Livingston. At the beginning of the project, RADIUS uses port 1645, which turned out to be conflicting with the service "datametrics". Now, the port is used by RADIUS is port 1812. The following is a RFC (Request For Comment) associated with RADIUS :
1.	RFC 2865 : Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)
2.	RFC 2866 : RADIUS Accounting
3.	RFC 2867 : RADIUS Accounting for Tunneling
4.	RFC 2868 : RADIUS Authentication for Tunneling
5.	RFC 2869 : RADIUS Extensions
