--------------

In today's humans have been unable to escape from the computer. Everything is so much faster job using a computer. In this case the computer can not be separated from the network, especially in network security. The problem that arises is that more equipment was not able to force the public to a user only. The conditions forced people in this information technology era has the ability to design computer network systems, or at least are able to install the computer network system independently.

OSI is a description of the function, purpose, and the framework of a structure to the process reference model that is logical in communication systems. While TCP / IP itself is a tool used to exchange data between one computer to another computer on a network on the Internet. OSI and TCP / IP is very important to learn, because today we must first understand more about how computer networks work. Because we do not only as users but we also have to be made.
